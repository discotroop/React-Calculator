## React Calculator

A basic calculator built in React. This is version 1. I Plan to expand the interface and functionality over time.

Users can perform basic math functions by clicking the onscreen buttons.

Supported Function:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Division
- Multiplication

Some Thoughts on ways to expand:
- Add tests in Jest.
- Add support for string together multiple operators before resolving
- Add support for parenthesis
- Refine the CSS/UI.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
